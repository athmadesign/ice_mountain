                <h2>Our Journey</h2>
                <p>Wanderlust was born in 2018 from a simple observation: travelers deserved better. Our founder spent years exploring 47 countries, testing dozens of bags, and learning what really matters when you're on the move.</p>
                <p>Every zipper that stuck, every strap that broke, every bag that looked worn after a single trip—these frustrations became our inspiration. We knew there had to be a better way to design travel gear.</p>
                <p>Today, we're proud to create bags that travelers actually love. Bags that work as hard as you do, look great anywhere, and last for years of adventures. That's the Wanderlust promise.</p>
